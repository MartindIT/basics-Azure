<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)

**1.) First Login to your Microsoft Azure account and click on "Resource Groups" then create a resource group and name it**

**2.) Then go back to the home page of azure and click on Virtual Machines and create**

**After that we will be on the next screen where you put in the Resource Group we just made and change the operating system to "Windows 10" then name your virtual machine**

**Then proceed with the appropite size I will choose 2 vcpus because I will be creating another VM for the next project**

**And after all that just make a log in for VM and accept and agree with the TOS and click review and create. (*the rest will be fine on default settings*)**

**3.) Once this finishes deployment we can go ahead and click on go to resource and the virtual machine will be ready.**

**When we are on this screen we will bring up Remote Desktop and copy and paste the public IP Address for the VM onto remote desktop and hit connect.**
